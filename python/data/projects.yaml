            summary: |
              Developed high-performance SDIO host controller driver for Intel StrongARM embedded platforms enabling 
              wireless connectivity through Marvell 802.11g WiFi chipsets. Optimized for maximum throughput on 
              resource-constrained ARM processors targeting portable and embedded applications.
            contributions:
              - "Architected and implemented complete SDIO host controller driver supporting 4-bit wide bus mode and clock management"
              - "Engineered DMA-based transfer mechanism achieving maximum theoretical 802.11g throughput (54 Mbps) on StrongARM platform"
              - "Optimized interrupt handling and data transfer pathways minimizing CPU overhead and latency"
              - "Developed comprehensive integration with Marvell WiFi chipset firmware achieving production-grade wireless connectivity"
